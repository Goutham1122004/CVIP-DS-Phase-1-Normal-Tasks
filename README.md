Project Title
Customer Behavior Analysis from Transaction Data

Project Description
Start with a brief overview of the project. Explain that the aim is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on transactional data to uncover insights into customer behaviors, preferences, and purchasing patterns. Highlight the importance of understanding customer behavior in strategic decision-making for businesses.

Objectives
List the main objectives of the project. For example:

To identify common purchasing patterns among customers.
To segment customers based on transaction history.
To uncover the relationship between different product categories and customer preferences.
To predict future purchasing behaviors based on historical data.
Data Source
Provide details about the data used in the project:

Mention the source of your transaction data, whether it's a publicly available dataset or synthetic data you've created for this analysis.
Include a brief description of the dataset, such as the number of transactions, the time period covered, and the type of information each transaction record contains (e.g., customer ID, date/time, product categories, amount spent).
Tools and Technologies Used
List the software, programming languages, libraries, and tools used in the project. For example:

Python for data processing and analysis.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook as the development environment.
Installation and Setup
Provide instructions on how to set up the project environment:

Installation steps for Python and necessary libraries.
Steps to clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.
Instructions to run the analysis, including any commands needed to execute the scripts or notebooks.
How to Use
